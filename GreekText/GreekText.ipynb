In Norse mythology, it is a final battle between the gods and the powers of evil. According to the myth, the beginning of the end would be signalled by men fighting each other, fathers killing their sons. A three-year winter (Fimvulvetr) would then ensue. The wolf, Skoll, would swallow the sun. The wolf Fenrir and bound Loki would break their bonds. Natural disasters will abound. It is foretold in legend that Heimdall, the guardian of the Æsir, will sound the Gjallarhorn, alerting the gods to the onset of the final battle against evil. A major figure on the side of evil is the Giant Sutr, who will fight with his flaming sword. In this battle, most of the Æsir will die. But out of Ragnarök, a new world will be born. A new sun will take the place of the old and some gods will return to the ruined Asgard, led by the resurrected Balder, the best and most beloved of gods.\n",
